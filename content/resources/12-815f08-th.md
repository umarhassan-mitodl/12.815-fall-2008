  caption: The dependence of light transmission through the atmosphere on light wavelength.
    Because of Earth's atmosphere, many wavelengths of radiation cannot be observed
    by detectors or telescopes on Earth's surface. Only visible light, radio waves,
    and some ultraviolet light reaches sea level. (Image courtesy of {{% resource_link
