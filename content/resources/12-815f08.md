description: The dependence of light transmission through the atmosphere on light
  wavelength. Because of Earth's atmosphere, many wavelengths of radiation cannot
  be observed by detectors or telescopes on Earth's surface. Only visible light, radio
  waves, and some ultraviolet light reaches sea level. (Image courtesy of NASA.)
